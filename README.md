# Room for improvements

## As I am submitting the assessment somewhat two days early, I see some things can still be improved in the application with some work here and there.

* Validations can be improved a little bit.
* An activity log can be added in all activities.
* Could have used a factory method to get the exception created instead of using 'new' keyword.
* Unit tests can be written.

NOTE: Mistakenly pushed a commit with my company email. Please ignore the 'chandimaei' contributor.
